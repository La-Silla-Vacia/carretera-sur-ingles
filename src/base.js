In 2016, coinciding with the Peace Agreement, 16.300 persons arrived and the goal for this year is 20.000.</p><p>This success story is, however, bittersweet.</p><p>La Macarena National Park harbors practically all the problems affecting Colombian national parks: deforestation, coca crops, intensive cattle farming, illegal logging and illegal roads.</p><p>Just last year La Macarena lost 1.499 hectares of forest, the equivalent to more than 2.000 football pitches.

In January twelve families took on the responsibility to safeguard 20 hectares of forest, counting the animals, enclosing water sources and planting native trees.</p><p>Perhaps the scale of their mission is not huge in area, but it is a pilot meant to prove that peasant communities –with an adequate accompaniment and financing- are ready to bet on livelihood alternatives that are compatible with the natural wealth of their region. That is, proving that they can live off the forest and with the forest.</p><p>The bend on the river they call home is a strategic enclave. Right in between the nearby villages of Puerto Cachicamo and Puerto Nuevo are the 15 crucial kilometers to maintain the connectivity line between the forests of Macarena Range National Park to the north and the rainforests of Chiribiquete National Park to the south.</p><p>These 15 kilometers of green corridor could disappear in months with the construction of the Marginal Road.

It could come down to this forest bridge –already fragile due to the accelerated deforestation- to ensure that the genes of different plant and animal species flow across the Guayabero river and thus between the Amazon and Orinoco biomes.</p><p>Protecting it, however, requires a change in mentality. “If there is no state and no guerrilla, and we see that we can scorch forest to create pastures, we will do it because there is no longer anyone to control us,” says Castañeda, echoing the recurring argument in the area against which he –and the scientists supporting him- are fighting.</p><p>Since January, these families are enclosing the small water sources to prevent cattle from contaminating them, planting native trees to recover the riparian corridors and to create generate livelihood options different to slashing and burning.</p><p>They are also counting the animals in the area, documenting <a href='goo.gl/Nr3ARS' target='_blank'>the prints</a> left by animals like tapirs, giant ant-eaters and wild pigs looking at water holes and jotting down the number of spider, tamarin and more elusive brown woolly monkeys and their offspring in the trees, valuable data that nourishes scientists’ research.</p><p>The risks of violence are still there however.

In two weeks of field work they registered 1.100 species of plants, 89 of fish, 32 oh amphibians, 58 of reptiles, 226 of birds and 48 of mammals.

Many of the information gaps that we have are in regions like this one that we had never been able to explore,” says ichthyologist Alexander Urbano-Bonilla.</p><p>He and his colleagues found almost one new species of small freshwater per day, including two translucent catfish measuring less than 3 cm that had never been described.</p><p>The risk of losing these patches of forest around the Marginal Road is that more important natural areas like La Macarena or Chiribiquete National Parks cannot function properly if they become islands among a sea of pastures.</p><p>This is why scientists who know the area are setting off alarm bells at the fact that the only green lines that still connect these three regions of Colombia are rapidly shrinking and lie exactly on the Road’s proposed route.</p><p>“If this buffer breaks, we will lose the connection between these ecosystems, the ability that species have to move around and, ultimately, all this biodiversity.

This was the first year Colombia won, with birders from across the country spotting 1,486 birds. Leading the group in Guaviare was Cesar Arredondo, a 25-year-old ornithologist with a perennial smile who works a tourist guide and who spends his free time chasing after new bird species with his binoculars.</p><p>“You might not believe it, but birds might help us halt extensive cattle farming and deforestation. We are betting on tourism because it’s becoming a viable economic alternative, but also –when done sustainably- in a way to preserve nature,” says Cesar, who finished his biology studies and returned to his native San Jose to start Biodiverso.travel, a travel agency specializing in nature tourism.</p><p>Along with other scientists and entrepreneurs, he is seeing tourism as an economic opportunity in a department ravaged by decades-long violence, where the state government is the largest employer and where the private sector is virtually non-existent.</p><p>There is still much work for Guaviare’s nascent industry to consolidate, but gradually the ghosts of conflict have disappeared and tourism is growing rapidly.
